# vue-app
This is my first Vue.js attempt. This is an simple todo task application.

```
### Run Server for Data
```
npm run backend
```
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
